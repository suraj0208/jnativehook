JNativeHook began in early 2006 as I was exploring options for creating global shortcuts in Java.  After 5 years of research and development the project and source code were made publicly available.  In addition to the countless hours of development time, there have been some out of pocket expenses for this project, including various keyboards and non-x86 hardware.  If I am able to raise enough money through donations and commercial licensing to cover these costs, I would like to re-release the project under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.
